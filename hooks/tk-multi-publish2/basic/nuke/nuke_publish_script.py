        Publishes the file to Shotgun. A <b>Publish</b> entry will be
        created in Shotgun which will include a reference to the file's current
        path on disk. If a publish template is configured, a copy of the
        current session will be copied to the publish template path which
        will be the file that is published. Other users will be able to access
        the published file via the <b><a href='%s'>Loader</a></b> so long as
        they have access to the file's location on disk.

        If the session has not been saved, validation will fail and a button
        will be provided in the logging output to save the file.

        <h3>File versioning</h3>
        If the filename contains a version number, the process will bump the
        file to the next version after publishing.

        The <code>version</code> field of the resulting <b>Publish</b> in
        Shotgun will also reflect the version number identified in the filename.
        The basic worklfow recognizes the following version formats by default:

        <ul>
        <li><code>filename.v###.ext</code></li>
        <li><code>filename_v###.ext</code></li>
        <li><code>filename-v###.ext</code></li>
        </ul>

        After publishing, if a version number is detected in the work file, the
        work file will automatically be saved to the next incremental version
        number. For example, <code>filename.v001.ext</code> will be published
        and copied to <code>filename.v002.ext</code>

        If the next incremental version of the file already exists on disk, the
        validation step will produce a warning, and a button will be provided in
        the logging output which will allow saving the session to the next
        available version number prior to publishing.

        <br><br><i>NOTE: any amount of version number padding is supported. for
        non-template based workflows.</i>

        <h3>Overwriting an existing publish</h3>
        In non-template workflows, a file can be published multiple times,
        however only the most recent publish will be available to other users.
        Warnings will be provided during validation if there are previous
        publishes.
